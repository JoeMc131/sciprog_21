# arctanx.c

This programme uses two methods to approximate arctanh(x):
- Using a numerical series.
- Using an analytical approximation method

The programme computes the arctanh(x) for a range of x and the two methods are compared with each other

# fibonacci.c

The programme utilises pointers and functions to computes the fiboncci sequence up to a certain point.

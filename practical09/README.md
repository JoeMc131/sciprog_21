# Magic_square.h

Determines whether a given matrix is 'magic', ie.) whether the diagonals columns and rows add up to the same value

# main_Read.c

Read in a matrix from a user defined file and determines whether the matrix is magic by using the Matrix_square.h header file

# main_User.c

Here the user fills in each element of the matrix which the user also defines the size of. Then the programme determines if the matrix is magic, also by using the matrix_square.h header file

This folder used to have a main.c file which contained the methods of the main_User.c and main_Read.c files, but then was split into the main_user and main_Read files.
